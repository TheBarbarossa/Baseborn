#Landless Character encounters a farmer in the autumn, who's struggling
#They can either give money to the farmer, and then recieve a letter saying thank you once winter comes
#or they can take their stuff and then find out they died
#or they can leave them alone, and find them either dead or almost dead, where they can then help
#5% chance it's a secret lord, who then gives them a weak hook favor, and 1000 gold.
