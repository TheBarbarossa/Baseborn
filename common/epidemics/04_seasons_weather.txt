#Hello!
#This is here as a temporary placeholder. Currently I plan to introduce major storms and weather in the form of the epidemic mechanic, as it should be visible on the map
#and spread on the map like a storm. It will mainly begin in the stormlands and stepstones in autumn for the time being, atleast for 
#Beta 0.2 Release. It is also a good way to activate events for players and characters.
